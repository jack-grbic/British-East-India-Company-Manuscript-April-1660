Scholars can draw information from two primary features of this petition: the text and the illustrations. The textual elements include both illumination, such as gold and once-gold text that has since flaked off and turned green over time, and sections of plain text. The visual components consist of an illuminated heading, a decorative ¾ border, and roundels incorporated into that border. Because the British colonial government produced a large volume of written material, the petition, which has such a broad title, could become buried in the digital space. This project aims to make the document more easily searchable, and therefore more useful to scholars, with specific metadata terminology from an established subject heading standard, such as the Rare Books and Manuscripts Section Subject Headings (RBMS). Because the petition contains both textual and visual information, relying solely on subject headings that privilege one aspect over the other would obscure potentially important information for scholars. RBMS contains a diverse range of vocabulary used in history and art, ensuring that both the historical-textual and historical-artistic dimensions of the petition are represented accurately and equitably. One challenge with labeling arose with the “green ink,” which was likely once gold; therefore, both “gold” and “ink” are listed as materials.


The HCR process for this document remained difficult because the text remained faded and the vellum contained marks and splotches of color that obscured the text. Experimentation with various HCR programs led to significant findings. Several HCR programs, such as Transkribus, produced word vomit transcriptions. I experimented with different trained models, but I could not generate a decipherable transcription. ChatGPT hallucinated information when asked to transcribe the document. The program that remained best was the web-based HandwritingOCR.com. The site produced an accurate transcription, and I did not need to intervene at all. The software indicated the illuminated heading on the Recto with bold text and used uppercase letters for illuminated letters (now green) in the body of the text. The only human addition to the transcription was the signature at the bottom of the Recto transcription, “Thomas Andrew: Governor.” I could not confidently decipher the other signatures, so I chose not to guess them in order to preserve the accuracy of the transcription. Spelling errors do occur in the transcription, but this is because they also appear in the original text, so I did not edit them out.
